### What is this?

This project implements a [Rewrite module](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) that performs common tasks when migrating to new version of [Cucumber-JVM](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm).

## Running migration recipes
Migration recipes can be run using the [rewrite-maven-plugin](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/rewrite-maven-plugin)
or [rewrite-gradle-plugin](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/gradle-plugin-configuration).
These can either be added to the build file of the project to be migrated or [run without modifying the build](https://docs.openrewrite.org/running-recipes/running-rewrite-on-a-maven-project-without-modifying-the-build).
